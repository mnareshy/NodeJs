1 - Install Node

unpack the lastest version of Node and setup classpath to bin directory.

2 - Install babel - babel is JavaScript transpiler. What that means is that we can take ES2015 code and make it work on all browsers, even ones that may not support it. Essentially Babel takes the ES2015 JavaScript code and compiles it into ES5 code. 

npm install -g babel
npm install -g babel-cli

Setup React

3 - mkdir ReactJS

4. npm init
